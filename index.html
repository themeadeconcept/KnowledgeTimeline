            <p>
              Nearing the end of my Bachelor's in Information Technology, I
              began to grow fond of programming challenges and the work in
              general. I started my Journey into the world of Programming with
              HTML/CSS. I had dabbled with C++, C#, Java, Python, and much
              more...but I love the interaction and experience that I get as a
              Web Developer.

            </h3>
            <p>
              The biggest part of learning Web Devlopment has been my
              understanding of JavaScript. Still a little tough to grasp but I
              can get things done, and getting better everyday with more
              practice. Currently working on learning Data Structuring and
              Algorithms.

            <p>
              In March I had been laid of from my job as a server, and with no
              end of the unemployment in sight...I began to focus VERY hard on
              my Developer Skills. Realizing the power of NPM was great, and I
              continued to push as I was hungry to learn more!

            <p>
              Bootstrap was my first real experience with a "framwork". It was
              great to implement and use this tool to my advantage.

            </h3>
            <p>
              In September, I set up a virtual machine through my Windows 10
              device, to set up Xubuntu 20 and get experience with Linux. I know
              am pretty decent in the command line, and would prefer it under
              some circumstances.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Soon after setting up my Linux machine, I began to experiment with
              API's their endpoints and how to implement them. I used WeatherMap
              and MailChimp as implementation tools.<br />
              Around the same time, I taught myself how to use EJS for a
              templating system to my page build outs.

            </h3>
            <p>
              In November I began using Database's to handle my data. I learned
              the basics of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD), also the
              differences between relational/non-relational databasing. Also
              learned how to implement these into my projects.

            <p>
              Currently learning SASS/SCSS and focusing hard on Front end
              Development (A passion I have discovered). Also simultaneously
              learning ES5/6 and increasing my Javascript knowledge (currently
              my largest weak point in my opinion). Learning current syntax to
              transition into React for a JS framework.

            <p>
              React.js is the next tech I would like to tackle, after I increase
              my Javascript skills/confidence.
